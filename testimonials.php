                                        <p>     Hi friends..Feeling happy to share my experience with 360 Ripples...One more life changing program organized by 360 Ripples. It is this kind of three day program where I started .The way they train here, the practical hands on we get here are limitless. The training pattern is so unique and gets updated time to time. We get Individual care for each and everyone . As far as my knowledge.industry level training is the need of the generation. People get to know lot of theoretical knowledge with less industry practices..But here you get that from day one. <b>The very reason am surviving in IT industry now is because of the training I got here.I got trained in Core Java and SQL here, now am working in a US based company BPMLinks, LLC, working in as a tie up with Infosys Mysore.</b> Please use this Opportunity folks, just come and attend with an open mind they will show you the way. All the best folks.</b>.

                                        <p>      I would like to share my few experience about my learning phase in 360 ripples. I have joined the core Java training in 360 ripples. It is the base
where i got interest in coding. <b>I thought coding is Very tough,difficult,it is not my cup of tea but really i loved the programming once i joined here.</b> For each and every concepts which i have learnt, i did handson for those concepts. The real thing i like here is, you will learn in a corporate style coding. you code like a person who works in curious. As the end of our course we have given a requirement to develop a standalone application. we divided and worked as a team.There is a different teams who handled database seperately ,GUI processing,corelogic of the requirement,Batch processing for the application.once you joined in some corporate you will get the feel that you design the coding like a corporate while you are in the learning phase. This is my personal experience and my perception where i phased during the learning process in 360 ripples and <b>I get placed in wipro</b> Thanks to gowtham my beloved friend who called me for the training. Thanks to Shanmu sir and Vasuki mam.

Fst of all thank you mam and sir for creating awarness about IT sector and about getting job.and personally i thank you for helping me to write program.basically I'm an Ece engineer. Fst you came to our college and spoke about the importance of learning a programming language. It created an intrest in me to learn programing for the first time. Then i joined java it was taken by mam it was the first time i learned how to think of logics and implement it in the program.they trained me by giving many hand's on and case studies and it was a great success.in the next semester i volunteered for j2EE by regretting all the courses since i fixed my path towards IT.J2EE taught me a lot such as HTML,CSS,JSP,SERVLET etc and finally in j2ee a project was given to me which i did perfectly without any help in such a way they trained me. Not only in training they are very friendly motivating us in every ups and downs.<b>i never thought that i could also write programs without them it iwas impossible</b> once again i thank both sir and mam.

Their teaching style is excellent, they teach us with industry projects, application & practical oriented, real time examples, more hands-on. They will clear each and everyone's doubt individually.

                                        <p>Training at 360 Ripples is very much different than other providers in the market. I got trained here in Java and Front End Web Designing which helped me to get easily placed in an IT Company with so much of confidence. Here they teach everything with real time examples which helped me grasp the concepts very quickly and easily. And the fees is also reasonable. 

                                        Don't think twice, just go for it you will not regret it...</p>
